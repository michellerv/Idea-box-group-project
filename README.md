# IdeaBox

### Abstract:
We built a fully functional website that allows users to create new ideas with a title and a body. These ideas can be anything the user imagines and it's fun for them to go wild and say things like cat purses or dog staches! It solves the problem of not having a place to put such ideas down and save them in a convenient way. Users can favorite an idea and show just those saved idea's and toggle back to all ideas.  

### Installation Instructions: 
  - Go to https://github.com/michellerv/Idea-box-group-project
  - Click the green button that says "code" on it to get the SSH key to clone the repository down  to your local machine.  
  - After copying the SSH code go into terminal and type in git clone and paste the SSH key behind it to clone a copy of the app to your machine. 
  - From there it can be opened by typing open index.html in the terminal. This will open it in an internet browser and upon opening it will be ready to use.

### Context: 
We are in mod 1 and had six days to complete it. We spent approximately 30 hours to finish it all up. It took longer than expected to set the comp up as the CSS tripped us a bit, but once that was done things rolled smoother.

### Learning Goals:
The major learning goals for this project were to show an understanding of how to write clean HTML, CSS and Javascript. We were expected to match the comp as close as possible. We needed to demonstrate our understanding of how to separate the data model from the DOM and appropriately update the data model first and then the DOM. This project let us practice incorporating and iterating over arrays to filter out what we wanted to display and at what time. Our code needed to be dry and written as such a way to strive towards single responsibility principle and purity. Practice problem solving complex problems and apply newly discovered information.

### Wins and Challenges:
So much of the project is a win, especially completing it! The first struggle happened with the function of having the save button be disabled on page load, stay disabled until both input forms are filled and then disabling again after a new idea is created. Upon getting it to work the first time, there were two bugs that came along with it that we had to solve. Getting it to function properly was a big win. The second challenge (and the biggest) was the third iteration of starring saved cards. It took us over 12 hours and much collaboration with other students. We finally found a solution that worked with our unique code, and was able to complete iteration 3 with no bugs.
